# ADR Write (MADR)

Scaffold a new ADR for the decision titled `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Steps

1. Determine the next ADR number: list `docs/adr/`, find the highest
   `NNNN-` prefix, increment (zero-padded to 4 digits). If none exist, start at
   `0001`. Filename: `docs/adr/NNNN-<kebab-title>.md`.
2. Seed **Context** from the repo: run `git log --oneline -10` and, if `gh` is
   authenticated, `gh issue list --state open --limit 10`. Summarize what is
   prompting this decision.
3. **Read the canonical template `docs/adr/template.md` and copy its structure
   verbatim** — do not invent your own headings. Fill `NNNN`, the title, today's
   date (from session context), and the seeded Context. Leave **Status:
   Proposed**. See the section spec in [references/template-guide.md](references/template-guide.md)
   for what each section must contain and how the seeded git/issue context maps
   onto it. If this project already has accepted ADRs, read the most recent one
   as a filled exemplar of the house style; on a fresh project there is none yet,
   so follow the template and the section spec.
4. Add an index line to `docs/README.md`.

## Template

The single source of truth is **[`docs/adr/template.md`](/docs/adr/template.md)**
(read it at generation time — do not paste a copy here that can drift). It uses
the sections: `Context`, `Decision`, `Alternatives Considered` (a table),
`Consequences` (Positive / Negative), `Validation / Rollout`, and `Links`.
`references/template-guide.md` explains each and where the seeded context lands.

## Output

Print the path of the created ADR and a one-line summary. Note that the
`app-architect` agent owns the decision content - this skill only scaffolds and
seeds it. Leave it `Proposed` for human/architect sign-off.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] File created at `docs/adr/NNNN-<kebab-title>.md` with correct zero-padded sequence number
- [ ] Structure matches `docs/adr/template.md` exactly (Context, Decision, Alternatives Considered table, Consequences Positive/Negative, Validation / Rollout, Links) - no ad-hoc headings
- [ ] Status is `Proposed` - not Accepted (that requires human/architect sign-off)
- [ ] `Alternatives Considered` table has at least the chosen option + one rejected alternative with a stated reason
- [ ] `Links` section points at the driving roadmap task / issue used to seed Context
- [ ] `docs/README.md` has a new index line for the ADR
- [ ] `/link-check` passes on the new file
