"""Reference specimen for /document-tests — the docstring format, one per class.

This is a *teaching example*, not a collected test (it lives under `.claude/`,
outside `tests/`, so pytest never runs it). Each function below shows two things
at once:

1. the structural signal `scripts/document_tests.py` keys on to classify it, and
2. the exact docstring the codemod emits and that
   [../references/classification-guide.md](../references/classification-guide.md)
   describes.

Docstring contract (enforced by the codemod's title regex
``^\\[(Unit|Mock|Integration|E2E)\\] .+: verifies .+\\.$``):

    [<Class>] <short name>: verifies <one sentence ending in a period>.

    Scenario: <what is set up and exercised>
    Boundaries: <what is real vs mocked; scope of the test>
    On-failure-first-check: <where to look first when this fails>

The imports point at ``shopfront``, a deliberately fictional order-management
package, so nothing here looks like it should resolve against your own code.
Read the *shape* — a real test importing the module under test, asserting on real
behaviour — and copy the docstrings, not the package name.

Note on classification: the codemod decides by **directory first, then body
markers**. This file is in an unrecognised directory, so the codemod would tag
each case `ambiguous` and fall back to the body signal — exactly the situation
where a human uses the semantic definitions in the classification guide. Note
that in an unrecognised directory a `CliRunner` body does *not* promote a test to
[E2E]; only the mock markers are consulted. The body of each function is written
so the *intended* class is unambiguous to a human reader.
