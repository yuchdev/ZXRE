description: User-invoked as /test-gap [path]. Spawns the testing-expert agent to analyse test coverage and returns a prioritised list of missing tests, risk-ranked (core decision/business logic and untrusted-input parsing first). Use to decide what to test next.

# Test Gap Analysis

Identify the highest-value missing tests for `$ARGUMENTS` (a module/dir, or the
whole package if empty).

## Steps

1. Establish current coverage:
   `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -q --cov=zxre --cov-report=term-missing`
   (scope with `--cov=zxre.<subpkg>` when a path is given).
2. Spawn the **`testing-expert`** agent with the coverage output and the target path. Ask it
   to map uncovered lines to behaviours and **risk-rank** them using the full
   [references/risk-ranking-rubric.md](references/risk-ranking-rubric.md)
   (blast-radius criteria + ZXRE module examples per tier):
   - **P0**: core decision/business-logic branches, untrusted-input parsing,
     escalation/approval paths, security-relevant branches.
   - **P1**: backend strategies, orchestrator transitions, schema validation.
   - **P2**: CLI/view formatting, logging.
3. Return the testing-expert agent's prioritised list.

## Output

```
## Test Gap - <target> (coverage: NN%)
### P0 - must test
- path:line-range - <untested behaviour> - <why risky> - <suggested test>
### P1 - should test
### P2 - nice to have
```
Offer to have `testing-expert` write the P0 tests next.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Coverage established with `--cov-report=term-missing` (scoped to the target when given)
- [ ] Every uncovered branch mapped to a *behaviour*, not just a line number
- [ ] Findings tiered P0/P1/P2 by blast radius per [references/risk-ranking-rubric.md](references/risk-ranking-rubric.md) - not by coverage-% delta
- [ ] Consensus/escalation/payload-parsing/security gaps ranked P0
- [ ] Each P0 has a concrete suggested test (input → expected outcome)
- [ ] Prioritised list returned; offer made to have `testing-expert` write the P0 tests
