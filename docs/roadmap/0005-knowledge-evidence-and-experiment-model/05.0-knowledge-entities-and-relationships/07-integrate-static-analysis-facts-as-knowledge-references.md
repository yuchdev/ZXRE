# Task 05.0 - Knowledge Entities and Relationships / Subtask 07 - Integrate static-analysis facts as knowledge references

## Objective

Create `src/zxre/knowledge/import_static.py`. Import or link deterministic routine candidates,
symbols, basic blocks and data ranges from Milestone 0003 into knowledge entities without upgrading
candidate semantics. Preserve source IDs and distinguish imported static facts from human/agent
semantic annotations.

## Constraints

- Keep implementation within Milestone 0005 scope.
- Do not add model-specific prompts, LLM calls, agents, Skills, autonomous hypothesis generation or
  autonomous experiment design.
- Preserve historical/audit state; avoid destructive mutation of hypotheses, evidence or promotion
  history.
- Evidence must reference immutable/durable source identities where possible.
- Floating-point model confidence must not become the canonical promotion mechanism.
- Use existing ArtifactStore, runtime, trace, capture, static-analysis and project abstractions rather
  than duplicating them.
- Update tests together with production code.

## Completion conditions

- All named files/APIs are implemented.
- Relevant unit/integration tests pass.
- `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run mypy src`, and `uv run pytest`
  remain green.
- Project state can be reopened with knowledge/evidence/hypothesis/experiment history intact.
- No unsupported semantic claim can be promoted merely by setting a high confidence value.
