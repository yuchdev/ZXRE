# Task 04.0 - Emulator Capability Contract / Subtask 06 - Add fake deterministic runtime backend for tests

## Objective

Create `tests/fakes/runtime_backend.py` and tests. Implement configurable capabilities, 64K memory,
register map, scripted PC sequence, breakpoint/watchpoint triggering, key event recording and
synthetic screen bytes. It is a deterministic fake, not a Z80 emulator.

## Constraints

- Keep implementation within Milestone 0004 scope.
- Generic runtime modules must not expose ZEsarUX/ZRCP or `zesarux-mcp` syntax, slot IDs, sockets or
  process objects.
- ZEsarUX is the preferred reference backend, not a required core dependency.
- `zesarux-mcp` and other debugger MCPs are optional companions, not required runtime providers.
- Persisted runtime outputs use ArtifactStore/provenance.
- Do not add LLM calls, agents, hypotheses, gameplay semantics or causal experiment planning.
- External/live emulator tests must skip cleanly when dependencies are unavailable.
- Update tests together with implementation.

## Completion conditions

- All named files/APIs are implemented.
- Backend-independent tests pass with the deterministic fake backend.
- Optional live ZEsarUX tests pass when configured and skip clearly otherwise.
- `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run mypy src`, and `uv run pytest`
  remain green.
- No core dependency on one emulator, MCP server or agent harness is introduced.
